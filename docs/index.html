  <h2>Adaptive Curvature for Stochastic Optimization</h2>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>Clone the repository and add the repository to your python path:</p>

  <dt-code block language="bash">
    git clone https://github.com/tpbarron/adacurv.git
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/adacurv/
  </dt-code>

  <p>If you would like to run the RL experiments additional paths must be set:</p>
  <dt-code block language="bash">
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/adacurv/experiments/mjrl/    # for the PyBullet RL experiments
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/adacurv/experiments/bbbot/   # for the Basketball robot simulation.
  </dt-code>

  <p>Install the dependencies:</p>
  <dt-code block language="bash">
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  </dt-code>

  <p>At this point one may run the samples in the experiments folder. To get started right away we
    have included a <dt-code language="python">quick_start.py</dt-code> file in the
    <dt-code language="html">mnist</dt-code> and <dt-code language="html">mjrl</dt-code>
    experiment directories that run a single experiment.
    Once that has finished the data can be plotted with the corresponding
    <dt-code language="python">plot_quick_start.py</dt-code> in the same directory script.
  <p>

  <h2>Using an AdaCurv Optimizer</h2>

  <p>The AdaCurv optimizers depend on a the ability to compute the derivative of the loss repeatedly
     (for each matrix-vector product) and thus require a loss closure to be passed. The framework
     provides several common, preimplemented loss closures in
     <dt-code language="python">adacurv/torch/optim/hvp_closures.py</dt-code>.
     For example, the MNIST experiment creates a
     <dt-code language="python">kl_closure</dt-code> at each optimization step that depends
     on the model, input and output data, and a loss function (in this case
     <dt-code language="python">mean_kl_multinomial</dt-code>
     because the Fisher is the Hessian of the KL divergence). This closure is then passed to the
     <dt-code language="python">optimizer.step</dt-code> function.
   </p>

  <dt-code block language="python">
    closure = kl_closure(model, data, target, mean_kl_multinomial)
    optimizer.step(closure)
  </dt-code>

  <p>The optimizer takes care of the rest of the optimization including the curvature-vector products
    and adaptive parameter updates behind the scenes.</p>
